Average_Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor:
  brick_parent: Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor
  brick_definition: The computed average temperature of air in a zone, over some period
    of time
Coldest_Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor:
  brick_parent: Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor
  brick_definition: The zone temperature that is coldest; drives the supply temperature
    of hot air. A computed value rather than a physical sensor. Also referred to as
    a 'Lowest Zone Air Temperature Sensor'
Warmest_Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor:
  brick_parent: Zone_Air_Temperature_Sensor
  brick_definition: The zone temperature that is warmest; drives the supply temperature
    of cold air. A computed value rather than a physical sensor. Also referred to
    as a 'Highest Zone Air Temperature Sensor'
