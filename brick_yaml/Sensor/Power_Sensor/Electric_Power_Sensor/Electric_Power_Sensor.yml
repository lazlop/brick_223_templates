Active_Power_Sensor:
  brick_parent: Electric_Power_Sensor
  brick_definition: Measures the portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle
    of the AC waveform, results in net transfer of energy in one direction
Reactive_Power_Sensor:
  brick_parent: Electric_Power_Sensor
  brick_definition: Measures the portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle
    of the AC waveform, is due to stored energy which returns to the source in each
    cycle
