  brick_definition: Target Setpoint (also known as Common Setpoint) is a reference
    point representing the desired unoccupied air temperature in a specific zone of
    a building. This setpoint acts as a baseline from which deadband setpoints are
    established by adding or subtracting a deadband width.
