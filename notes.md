Applied to Point.yml and Status.yml just saying if we can represent things in the notes.
 - TODO items marked in notes using TODO. These TODO items describe changes to make to the yml to support the creation of templates
 - Ability to represent things in these files described using Can''t represent (or can't represent depending on editor) will need to pull out these notes

 Notes otherwise describe things that may be out of scope for 223P or that we need to add to 223P to be able to represent the brick classes.
